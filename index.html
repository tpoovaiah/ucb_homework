            <p>Tanya is an animator and story artist based in Northern California. She holds a BFA degree in Animation from California College of the Arts, and has experience in a variety of settings, from working as a story artist at Evil Eye Pictures, to most recently working in higher education as the Animation Studio Manager at her alma mater, California College of the Arts.

            Tanya loves to tell unique stories with an unexpected twist, and delights in making people laugh. Creating characters that are honest and sincere, and telling stories that resonate with people, is what drives her. Tanya is passionate about art, education, technology, and innovation.

            When she’s not animating, you can often find Tanya practicing martial arts, playing the piano, or teaching herself to play the guitar. Tanya also enjoys traveling, cooking (more like experimenting!) and video games.
